# 🧪 EasyCoach Optimizations Test

## Backend Tests

### 1. Pagination Test
```bash
# Test pagination is working
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/players?page=1&perPage=5" | jq '.players | length'
# Expected: 5 players

curl "http://localhost:8080/api/players?page=2&perPage=5" | jq '.players | length'
# Expected: 5 players (different players)
```

### 2. Search Test

# Test search functionality
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/players?search=messi&page=1&perPage=10" | jq '.players'
# Expected: Players with "messi" in name
```

### 3. Performance Test
```bash
# Run benchmark script
docker exec -it easycoach-backend-1 php /var/www/bin/benchmark.php
# Expected: All tests pass with < 50ms response times
```

# Expected: {"status":"healthy","optimized":true}
```

### Players List
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/players?page=1&perPage=10"
